"""
Wrapper around an iterator that dynamically (and reproducibly!) separates it into
examples that are allowed to pass through and examples that aren't, with a certain
percentage.
In other words: it does holdout. You can select whether you want either or both of
the splits to be let through.

Given the same deterministic iterator, this class will always select the same
examples to assign to the train or test split, even across multiple object instances.
