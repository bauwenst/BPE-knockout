"""
Goal: BPE-knockout, a post-processing step for BPE where you knock some subwords out of the vocab and rewrite its merge
rules using its two parents. This involves two additional problems solved here:
    1. A BPE tokenisers that can merge triplets, quadruplets ... tuples of any length >= 2.
    2. A way of deciding which types to knock out of the vocabulary. I came up with "blame ratio", see below.

TODO:
    - For the use-cases where you chain annealing and knockout, it could be an idea to have the first be based on a
      heuristic, and have the second iterate as many times as the first. I.e.: if knockout removes 100 merges, anneal
      then adds 100 merges, ending up with the same vocab size.
    - I was wondering if you could use e-Lex morphologies themselves to induce segmentation rules; don't look at the
      character-level patterns, but at the morph-level patterns. This is hard though, because morphologies show you how
      to split, yet BPE is based on merging, not splitting.
    - Holdout ratio and seed should be part of the config, as should the fact of whether or not knockout has already been run.

        Iterative knockout, with attempts to turn tuple merges back into binary merges (reification) in between.
        ---
        There are subtle problems this implementation addresses, to do with the many-to-many properties of this task:
            - Nested knockout: it is actually the case that some types are knocked out whose own types were knocked out too.
              Take as example 'am+aatregelen -> amaatregelen', where 'a+m' is wrong and 'aat+regelen' is also wrong.
              For these subwords, more than 1 new merge can be performed after 1 iteration.
              This is a problem for iterative knockout (see below), but also for knockout itself, since you get way more
              fragmentation than you asked for (in the extreme: you can devolve to character level after one iteration).

            - Priorities: if you want to insert a sub-merge (bru+id) before a triplet merge (bru+id+s), you not only have to edit the triplet to
              become a pair again (bruid+s), but also, you have to ensure that the sub-merge happens before the now-binary triplet. If not,
              the triplet will be asking for a type that can never occur when it is applied. This is solvable by not adding
              sub-merges at the very end of the vocab, EXCEPT:
                1. If the sub-merge does exist: pray that it happens before the triplet. Since you can't really move the sub-merge (because it is
                   embedded at that position in the BPE lattice for a reason), you can move the triplet merge to follow it, but this is a problem:
                   what do you do when the triplet has more than one submerge? It can't follow all of them.
                2. If the sub-merge doesn't already exist: insert the sub-merge at a priority -0.5 from the triplet, and
                   even if the triplet has more than one submerge, you can work with this by offsetting them from each other by .001.
                   But what do you do when the same submerge is available in multiple triplets?

        Note by the way that this is about MERGES existing, not TYPES. Indeed, inserting merges can break OFS (which isn't
        a bad thing), e.g. by merging bru+id even if br+uid already exists.

        Possible solution for case 1: move the triplet above the highest existing submerge.
            - Problem with this: cannot be higher than the first merge that uses the triplet's result.
              In fact, moving the triplet upwards can result in a contradiction. Take as example
                a b
                ab c
                abc d
                b c
              With knockout on a+b. The triplet is a+b+c. We want to add b+c. It already exists. We move the triplet to after b+c. Now abc+d is impossible,
              unless you ALSO move abc+d to after b+c, and the merges that use abcd, and the merges that use their results, and ... which will probably mess up too much.

              You can't solve this by duplicating the triplet and moving that triplet upwards, because then the first instance
              would merge the characters of the second instance.
                a b
                a b c
                abc d
                b c   <-- can never happen if it follows 'a'
                a bc  <-- can never happen
            - Alternative solution: don't move any merges.

        Possible solution for case 2: put the submerge under the lowest triplet in which it appears. (Do this after moving triplets upward due to existing merges, i.e. case 1.)
            - You luckily can't get a contradiction this way, because the parts merged by the sub-merge merging will always be formed
              before any triplet that uses those parts already.
        ---
        Do note that other merges are affected by any reordering, but we will assume this isn't detrimental as long as we don't disable them.
        To test if a merge has been fully disabled, a simple check is to see if the subword as a string can still be merged.

        It is easy to prove that a necessary condition for a type in the vocabulary of a BPE tokeniser to ever be formed
        is that the tokeniser forms it when you tokenise the type itself in string form:
            - In strings where it doesn't appear, it can never be formed.
            - In strings where it does appear, the only thing that could change vs. when it is alone as a string is that
              a neighbouring character could merge with one of the type's characters, but then it can once again no longer
              be formed as a token because now you always have an extra character you can't lose.

        Because vanilla BPE's segmentation is an exact replay of its vocabularisation, we also know that in vanilla BPE
        a type is actually formed when it is offered to the tokeniser as a string.

        With knockout, this is no longer true. E.g.: the type "_bruids" is formed by a merge "_bru + ids" which becomes
        "_bru + id + s" after knockout of the merge "id + s". However, because the merge "_bru + id" already exists and
        appears before this merge, there will never be a token sequence [_bru, id, s] when you arrive at the triplet merge.
        At best, there will be sequences [_bruid, s], for which you don't know a merge.

        Reification can correct such disabilities, but likely also create more of them.
