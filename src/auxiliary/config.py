"""
Global configuration of the project.
The purpose of this script is to provide all paths to necessary files,
and to impute those files if they don't exist.

Sits at the bottom of the import hierarchy: it should import the bare minimum
of project files, and be imported itself by most project files.

It itself cannot run anything. Imputation should only be done by calling its
functions.

# All files access this object for paths. Because it is an object, its fields can be changed by one
# file (main.py) and those changes are available to all files. Hence, you call something like
#       PROJECT.config = setupDutch()
# in main.py.
#
# You could imagine two alternatives:
#   1. In this file, defining a CONFIG = setupDutch(). The downside is that this can only be controlled from inside this
#      file, rather than from a central control file.
#   2. In main.py, defining a CONFIG to be imported by all other files. This doesn't work because main.py is all the way
#      at the top of the import hierarchy and hence you would get circular imports.
#
# The trade-off you make by taking the current approach over approach (1) is that there are two configs defined in the
# project: one is the default above, the other is the one in main.py. The one above is used for all executions that do
# not use main.py (every instance of 'if __name__ == "__main__"' and also all executions starting from outside this
# codebase, e.g. those that import BTE), the other is used only for executing main.py.
