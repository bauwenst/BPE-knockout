    Due to a bug (that has now been fixed), the corpus was being split on
    only spaces rather than tabs, newlines, ... and hence the latter all
    ended up in words. The newlines caused the most havoc, but the others
    are also wrong.

    For example: the string
    '''
    Hello world, how
    are you doing? Like, how
    are you?
    '''
    supposedly contains the word "how\nare" twice, which then shows up
    in the word file as
    '''
    how
    are 2
    '''
    which then overwrote the old count for "are" and also lost 2 "how"s.

    This function overwrites a word file with correct counts. Note that a space
    can never be present in a word, which means that we can differentiate between
    numbers that are words and numbers that are counts:
    '''
    efg 1
    abc 69420
    abd 1
    '''
    could come from a word "efg" and a word "abc\t69420\nabd". There's no space in front of the 69420
    so it isn't a count written by the word file.

    You can't solve it by only allowing counts lower than the previous count, because
    then the 0 in the following example will invalidate all words below it:
    '''
    Trendprodukte	cbd 1
    schmerzmittel	0
    Essential 1

    For the Dutch OSCAR corpus, there seem to be erroneously long entries, as well as non-Dutch entries.
    However, there are also long entries that are legit and longer than some non-legit entries:
        - geschillenbeslechtingsprocessen: 31 chars
        - socialehuisvestingsmaatschappijen: 33 chars
        - beroepsaansprakelijkheidsverzekeraars: 37 chars
        - toezichthoudersaansprakelijkheidsverzekering: 44 chars

    There are more entries of 45+ chars than VS Code can count, but I haven't found any legit one. You can scroll
    through them with the regex:
        \S{45}\S* [0-9]
    or if you want to eliminate Unicode and numbers:
        [A-z]{45}[A-z]* [0-9]

    There is also a non-alphanumeric line the tokenizer just got stuck on, consisting of the character "æ€¨" 21000 times.
    In short: we need some cleaning before processing.

    Some watertight rules:
        - Delete any word with a character in the below regexes (very foreign alphabets).
        - Delete any word that's way too long.
        - Delete any word that contains an underscore.
        - Delete any word that has disjunct numbers in it (highly likely to be an internet username; will exclude "H2O2" and "H2CO3" and so on, but not CO2 or H2O)

    I'm also quite tempted to lowercase all-caps words. For non-acronyms, this is a stylistic and not a linguistic effect
    and the word means the same thing in uppercase or lowercase. There are also a bunch of incorrect camelcased words in
    the corpus, but since there exist honest camelcased words (iPod, kWh, mAh, pH, dB ...) I will let those slide.
    I'm hoping that the sheer size of OSCAR means that true words are orders of magnitude more impactful than exceptions.

    Would be a neat experiment to indicate which parts of the word distribution are fraudulent. I think that most of the
    spam is not at frequency 1, but rather 10-100. At frequency 1 you find authentic words:
        appeltiramisu 1
